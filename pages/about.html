        The Premier League is the organising body of the Premier League with responsibility for the competition, its
        Rule Book and the centralised broadcast and other commercial rights.
        However, we do not operate in isolation. We work proactively and constructively with our Member Clubs and the
        other football authorities to improve the quality of football, both in England and across the world.

        <b>The Member Clubs of the Premier League</b>
    </h4>
    <p>
        The Premier League is a private company wholly owned by its 20 Member Clubs who make up the League at any one
        time.

        Each individual club is independent, working within the rules of football, as defined by the Premier League, The
        FA, UEFA and FIFA, as well as being subject to English and European law.

        Each of the 20 clubs are a Shareholder in the Premier League. Consultation is at the heart of the Premier League
        and Shareholder meetings are the ultimate decision-making forum for Premier League policy and are held at
        regular intervals during the course of the season.

        The Premier League AGM takes place at the close of each season, at which time the relegated clubs transfer their
        shares to the clubs promoted into the Premier League from the Football League Championship.
